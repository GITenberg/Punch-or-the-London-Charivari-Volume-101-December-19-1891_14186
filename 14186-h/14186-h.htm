    <p>The Baron's Assistants say that of the Christmas works
    published by Messrs. HUTCHINSON &amp; CO. they can and do
    recommend <i>The Children of Wilton Chase</i> by L.J. MEAD, to
    which they accord their mead of praise, which likewise they
    bestow on FLORENCE MARRYAT's <i>The Little Marine and the
    Japanese Lily</i>, a book of adventures in the land of the
    Rising Sun, which will delight many rising sons for whom
    chiefly was this book intended. There are always "more ways
    than one," and so <i>Where Two Ways Meet</i> there is like to
    be a puzzle, solved in this instance by the authoress, SARAH
    DOUDNEY. Put down the books! Come to the festive board!
    Down&mdash;(the right way of course) with the mince-pie and
    plum-pudding! Strange is it that the source of so much
    enjoyment, the very types of Christmas good cheer, should
    themselves be so "down in the mouth" as invariably are Mathew
    Mince-pie and Peter Plum-pudding at this festive season. And
    they being gone and cleared off, enter a gentleman bearing the
    unusual and remarkable name of SMITH&mdash;familiarly welcomed
    as "TOM" of that ilk&mdash;and then pop go the crackers! "But
    we must keep the secret," whisper the Baron's Assistants, and
    they strongly advise everyone not to peep into this <i>boîte à
    surprise</i> until Christmas Day itself. So, for SPARAGNAPANE's
    "charming confections, which," as the Baron's young lady
    clerks, BLYTHE and GAY, observe, "are in the very highest style
    of 'High Art'; and the same Mr. SPARE-NA-PAIN's <i>Darkest
    Evening, and How to Get Out of It</i>, will be tidings of
    comfort and joy to many a holiday-making household."</p>

    <h2>A TRULY ROORAL OPERA.</h2>

    <p>Sorry, indeed, are all London lovers of music at the sudden
    departure from our midst and mist of <i>Cavalleria
    Rusticana</i>, the Rustic Cavalier. It is no comfort to us to
    be told that the Rustic Cavalier will go into the provinces and
    appeal to the country. His province at present should have been
    to remain in London, where, with nothing to speak of in the way
    of <i>mise-en-scène</i>, he&mdash;that is, his composer, PIETRO
    MASCAGNI&mdash;has made a decided hit. Wise was our Signor LAGO
    "<i>al factotum</i>" in producing this, and knowing, too, must
    he be in his use of Windsor soap to have so speedily "taken the
    cake." Nay more, did not HER GRACIOUS MAJESTY absolutely retain
    a Royal Box at the Shaftesbury up to the last night of the run
    of this one-Act Opera? "<i>Ah, bravo, Figaro, bravissimo!
    Fortunatissimo</i>!" What a treat, too, to hear again the
    "<i>Che faro</i>." which brought down the Curtain, and brought
    down the House, on this termination to GLUCK's <i>Orfeo</i>.
    Strong, indeed, must be the <i>Cavalleria</i> to be successful
    after the <i>Che taro</i>: but it was.</p>

    <p>The Overture, the solo sung, by way of novelty, behind the
    Curtain, by TURIDDU,&mdash;(what a name! like the commencement
    of a comic nonsensical chorus! TURIDDU ought to have been in
    love with Tulla Lieti and have behaved badly to Tralala. "But
    this is another story.")&mdash;the choruses, and most of the
    concerted pieces are charming; and, above all, the
    <i>intermezzo</i>, which, were the piece in two Acts, would he
    the overture to the Second Act is simply so fascinating, that
    without a dissentient voice from a full house it was warmly and
    heartily encored, and would have been called for a third time
    had the judicious Signor ARDITI shown the slightest sign of
    conceding a supply to a fresh demand. None of the solos, except
    the one sung behind the Curtain, are particularly catching, or
    dramatically effective. Mlle. ELANDI, as <i>Santuzza</i>, acts
    and sings well; and Signor BERTINI, with a good voice, is about
    as stiff in action as a rustic Cavalier would naturally be;
    while Signor BROMBARA's <i>Alfio</i> the Mule-driver is
    histrionically just about perfect. Of course it will not he
    long ere we hear it again, and under vastly improved
    conditions.</p>

    <h2>A MAYOR AND OLD HUNTER.</h2>

    <p>Last Thursday the Fishmongers gave a banquet in their hall
    to the Duke of BEAUFORT and other Masters of Hounds. But why
    should the Fishmongers thus publicly advertise themselves as
    "going to the dogs." What fishly a-fin-ity is there between
    hounds and herrings, except in the running of a drag? However,
    the Lord MAYOR improved the occasion, which we dare say judging
    from the liberal hospitality, or, in this instance
    hoss-pitality, of the Fishmongering Corporation, scarcely
    required improvement, to inform His Grace of BEAUFORT and other
    noble sportsmen that he too was a hunting man, and that Lord
    Mayors of London ought as a rule to he hunting men if they
    would keep up the ancient traditions of their office. Why
    doesn't his sporting and equestrian Lordship revive the "Lord
    Mayor's Hounds" of the time of GEORGE THE FIRST? The meet might
    be in Leadenhall Market, or in a still meater place,
    Smithfield, and a bag fox being turned out, they might, on a
    good scenting day, have a fine burst of a good forty minutes,
    taking Houndsditch in their stride away across Goodman's Fields
    then away across Bethnal Green, tally-hoing down Cambridge
    Road, and then with a merry burst, into Commercial Road East,
    gaily along Radcliff Highway, and running into sly Reynard in
    Limehouse Basin. Stepney! Yoicks! On hunting days there would
    be a placard on the Mansion House door with the words, "Gone
    Away!" And of course there would be a list of the meets
    appended to all the usual notices. Let the present Lord MAYOR
    start this, and his Mayoralty will indeed be a memorable
    one.</p>

    <h2>THE HYPNOTISED LOBSTER.</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[Mr. ERNEST HART said, in a recent Lecture, that snakes,
        frogs, and lobsters could be hypnotised like human
        beings.]</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>'Tis the voice of the Lobster, I hear him
            complain,</p>

            <p>That hypnotic suggestion is on me again;</p>

            <p>I was mesmerised once and behold, since that
            time,</p>

            <p>I have yielded myself to suggestions of crime:</p>

            <p>I have compassed the death of an innocent "dab,"</p>

            <p>And attempted to poison an elderly crab.</p>

            <p>And they're holding a meeting just now in the
            rocks</p>

            <p>To decide whether I, who was once quite a saint,</p>

            <p>Should be put, as the doctors say, under
            restraint.</p>

            <p>I intend to go there in the midst of a trance.</p>

            <p>And, may I be boiled, but I'll lead them a
            dance!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>It's a terrible thing, when to virtue inclined.</p>

            <p>That some vile Mesmeriser debauches your mind;</p>

            <p>When awake I recoil from the things that I've
            done,</p>

            <p>Such as scrunching the poor little mussels for
            fun.</p>

            <p>In these fetters hypnotic a foe holds me fast,</p>

            <p>And you'll find that they'll hang me, in seaweed, at
            last.</p>

    <p>Last Friday there appeared a startling paragraph, announcing
    the first appearance of a New Island. Appropriately, it was on
    the face of <i>The Globe</i>. The intelligence came to us
    <i>viâ</i> Marseilles. Did it come up to the surface ready
    furnished for occupation, as in our second National Anthem
    about "Britons never being slaves" Britain is described as
    doing? The quotation is:&mdash;"When Britain first at Heaven's
    command, Arose from out the azure main," (or words to that
    effect), She (the Island) came up with a ready-made charter,
    and was open to be taken furnished. If this is the case, with
    the new Island, the sooner some parties "who won't be missed"
    pack off, bag and baggage, and take possession of the property,
    the better. It's a chance. "Island to Let. Ready furnished.
    Quite ready for occupation when thoroughly dry. No Agents need
    apply. Ground-Swell Landlord, Neptune, C. district."</p>

    <h2>ILLEGAL FICTIONS.</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>Interior of a Publisher's Office, shortly
        after the trial of Pinnock</i> v. <i>Chapman and
        Hall</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Publisher</i>. We have given our best attention to your
    Manuscript of a three-volumed novel, called&mdash;let me see,
    what did you call it? Oh, yes, here it is!&mdash;called,
    <i>Haunted by Sixteen Goblins</i>, and we are afraid it won't
    do.</p>

    <p><i>Literary Aspirant</i> (<i>pained</i>). Won't
    <i>do</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Pub.</i> (<i>calmly</i>). No. Won't do a bit&mdash;at
    least, not in its present form. You see, you introduce a Pirate
    Chief, named Captain WILDFIRE, who lives at Singapore, and who
    murders the mate, the steward, five seamen, and all the
    Passengers of the <i>Jolly Seamew</i>, the vessel that he
    commands, and appropriates five million dollars belonging to
    his employers, the vessel's owners.</p>

    <p><i>Lit. Asp.</i> Quite so. I thought those incidents would
    be rather exciting. They're so new. Do you object to the
    murders, or what?</p>

    <p><i>Pub.</i> Oh, dear no! But now this name, Captain
    WILDFIRE. (<i>Suspiciously.</i>) Are you sure there is nobody
    whose name is at all like it, and who also resides at
    Singapore?</p>

    <p><i>Lit. Asp.</i> I took the name quite by chance. I've never
    been near Singapore in my life.</p>

    <p><i>Pub.</i> (<i>relieved</i>). Glad to hear it. One has to
    be so careful nowadays. Here's an Army List&mdash;let us see if
    anybody called WILDFIRE figures in it. Ha! What's this! "Major
    WILDMAN, 217th Hussars." (<i>Gazes at</i> Lit. Aspirant
    <i>sternly.</i>) Is your Captain WILDFIRE intended as a
    caricature of Major WILDMAN, Sir, or is it not?</p>

    <p><i>Lit. Asp.</i> (<i>astonished</i>). Why, of course not! I
    never heard of the man.</p>

    <p><i>Pub.</i> Very likely not. <i>We</i> should hear of him
    precious soon if we published your novel as it stands.</p>

    <p><i>Lit. Asp.</i> But what reason is there to suppose this
    Major WILDMAN has ever been to Singapore? And how can a captain
    of a merchantship like the <i>Jolly Seamew</i> be confused with
    a Major in the Army who has never commanded a vessel in his
    life?</p>

    <p><i>Pub.</i> (<i>doggedly</i>). All very well; but the name
    must come out. Then I don't like this description of the Ninth
    Goblin at all. Where is it? Oh, here! (<i>Reads.</i>) "Even the
    cerements of the tomb enveloping the form of the Ninth Goblin
    could not hide&mdash;nay, seemed rather to bring prominently
    forward&mdash;the malignant expression of the one-eyed face,
    with its crop of red whiskers, beetle brows, and low receding
    forehead."</p>

    <p><i>Lit. Asp.</i> What's wrong with <i>that</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Pub.</i> Wrong! Everything's wrong! There are lots of
    people about with red whiskers and low receding foreheads, and
    they'll all bring actions of libel.</p>

    <p><i>Lit. Asp.</i> But <i>my</i> Goblin has only one eye.</p>

    <p><i>Pub.</i> Well, so may they. They're equal to taking one
    eye out and putting it back when the trial's over, if they
    thought it'd help them to get money out of <i>us</i>. There may
    be a fellow called Mr. GOBLIN somewhere, too. Oh, no; it won't
    do at all. All the chapters with the Ninth Goblin in must come
    out.</p>

    <p><i>Lit. Asp.</i> (<i>aghast</i>). But that would spoil the
    book&mdash;it would mean leaving out half of it.</p>

    <p><i>Pub.</i> Yes, it would reduce the bulk, no doubt. In any
    case we could not produce it in a three-volume form. But we are
    bringing out a series of cheap fictions, and we might include
    yours.</p>

    <p><i>Lit. Asp.</i> (<i>making the best of things</i>). Well,
    <i>some</i> good books have appeared in a shilling form.</p>

    <p><i>Pub.</i> Yes. But it's not a shilling form we should
    propose. The fact is, that there is a great run on Penny
    Novelettes just now, and&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Lit. Asp.</i> (<i>rising</i>). And you dare to propose
    bringing out the <i>Sixteen Goblins</i> as a Penny
    Novelette!</p>

    <p><i>Pub.</i> Certainly, and in view of the risk of actions
    for libel, you would have to pay the printing-bill, and give us
    a contract of indemnity in case your <i>Captain Wildfire</i>
    did turn out to be identical with some retired pirate who feels
    himself hurt at your description. You don't think much of the
    proposal? Well, nor do we of the book, to tell you the truth.
    Ta, ta!</p>

    <h3>No. XIX.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>The Tombs of the</i> SCALIGERS <i>at
        Verona. A seedy and voluble</i> Cicerone, <i>who has
        insisted upon volunteering his services, is
        accompanying</i> Miss TROTTER, BOB PRENDERGAST, <i>and</i>
        CULCHARD. <i>It is a warm afternoon, and</i> CULCHARD,
        <i>who has been intrusted with</i> Miss T.'s <i>recent
        purchases&mdash;two Italian blankets, and a huge pot of
        hammered copper&mdash;is not in the most amiable of
        moods.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The Cicerone</i> (<i>in polyglot</i>). Ecco, Signore
    (<i>pointing out the interlaced ladders in the wrought-iron
    railings</i>), l'échelle, la scala, c'est tout
    flexible&mdash;(<i>He shakes the trellis</i>)&mdash;molto,
    molto curioso!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>bitterly, to the other two</i>). I
    <i>warned</i> you how it would be! We shall have this sort of
    thing all the afternoon <i>now</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, I don't mind; he's real polite and
    obliging&mdash;and that's something, anyway!</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Polite and obliging! Now I <i>ask</i>
    you&mdash;has he given us the slightest atom of valuable
    information <i>yet</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I guess he's too full of tact to wish to
    interfere with your special department!</p>

    <p><i>The Cic.</i> (<i>to</i> CULCHARD, <i>who looks another
    way</i>). Ici le tombeau di GIOVANNI DELLA SCALA, Signore.
    Verri grazioso molto magnifique, joli conservé! (<i>He skins up
    on the pedestal, and touches a sarcophagus</i>.) Non
    bronzo&mdash;verde-antique!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Nods at</i> CULCHARD, <i>with a beaming
        smile.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with a growl</i>). Va bene, va
    bene&mdash;<i>we</i> know all about it!</p>

    <p><i>Bob P. You</i> may; but you might give Miss TROTTER and
    me a chance, you know!</p>

    <p><i>The Cic.</i> Zees, Marmor di Carrara; <i>zat</i>, Marmor
    di Verona&mdash;Verona marbre. MARTINO PRIMO a fait bàtir.
    (<i>Counting on his fingers for</i> CULCHARD's <i>benefit.</i>)
    Quattuor dichièmé secolo&mdash;<i>fotteen</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Will you kindly understand that I am quite
    capable of estimating the precise period of this sculpture for
    myself.</p>

    <p><i>The Cic.</i> Si-si, Signore. Scultore BONINO DA
    CAMPIGLIONE. (<i>With a wriggle of deferential enthusiasm.</i>)
    Bellissimo scultore!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> He's got an idea you find him vurry
    instructive, Mr. CULCHARD, and I guess, if you want to disabuse
    him, you'd better do it in Italian.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I think my Italian is equal to conveying an
    impression that I can willingly dispense with his society.
    (<i>To the</i> Cic.) Andate via&mdash;do you understand?
    An-da-te <i>via</i>!</p>

    <p><i>The Cic.</i> (<i>hurt, and surprised</i>). Ah,
    Signore!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He breaks into a fervent vindication of his value as
        guide, philosopher, and friend.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I guess he's endeavouring to intimate that
    his wounded self-respect isn't going to be healed under haff a
    dollar. And every red cent I had went on that old pot! Mr.
    CULCHARD, will you give him a couple of francs for me?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I&mdash;er&mdash;really see no necessity. He's
    done nothing whatever to deserve it!</p>

    <p><i>Bob P.</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). May <i>I</i>. Miss TROTTER?
    (<i>Producing a ten-lire note</i>.) This is the smallest change
    I've got.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> No. I guess ten francs would start him with
    more self-respect than he's got any use for. Mr. CULCHARD will
    give him three&mdash;that's one apiece&mdash;to punish him for
    being so real mean!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). Mean? because I&mdash;!
    (<i>He pays and dismisses the Cic.</i>) Now we can examine
    these monuments in peace&mdash;they are
    really&mdash;er&mdash;unique examples of the sepulchral pomp of
    Italian mediævalism.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> They're handsome tombs enough&mdash;but
    considerable cramped. I should have thought these old
    Scallywags would have looked around for a roomier burying lot.
    (<i>To</i> CULCHARD, <i>who shivers</i>.) You aren't feeling
    sick any?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> No&mdash;only pained by such a travesty of a
    noble name. "Scallywags" for SCALIGERS seems to me, if I may
    say so, a very cheap form of humour!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, it's more than cheap&mdash;it isn't
    going to cost you a cent, so I should think you'd appreciate
    it!</p>

    <p><i>Bob P.</i> Haw&mdash;score for <i>you</i>, Miss
    TROTTER!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I should have thought myself that mere
    personality is hardly enough to give point to any
    repartee&mdash;there is a slight difference between brilliancy
    and&mdash;er&mdash;<i>brutality</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Bob P.</i> Hullo! You and I are being sat upon pretty
    heavily, Miss TROTTER.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I guess our Schoolmaster's abroad. But why
    Mr. CULCHARD should want to make himself a train out of my
    coverlets, I don't just see&mdash;he looks majestic enough
    without that.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[CULCHARD <i>catches up a blanket which is trailing, and
        says bad words under his breath.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4><i>At the Tomb of Juliet.</i></h4>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>who is gradually recovering his
    equanimity</i>). Think of it! the actual spot on which
    <i>Romeo</i> and <i>Juliet</i>&mdash;SHAKSPEARE's
    <i>Juliet</i>&mdash;drew their last breath! Does it not realise
    the tragedy for you?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, no&mdash;it's a disappointing tomb. I
    reckoned it would look less like a horse-trough. I should have
    expected <i>Juliet's</i> Poppa and Momma would want,
    considering all the facts of the case, to throw more style into
    her monument!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>languidly</i>). May not its very
    simplicity&mdash;er&mdash;attest the sincerity of their
    remorse?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Do you attach any particular meaning to that
    observation now? (CULCHARD <i>bites his lip.</i>) I notice this
    tomb is full of visiting cards&mdash;my! but ain't that
    curious?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>instructively</i>). It only shows that
    this place is not without its pathos and interest for
    <i>most</i> visitors, no matter what their nationality may be.
    You don't feel inclined yourself to&mdash;?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> To leave a pasteboard? Why I shouldn't sleep
    any all night, for fear she'd return my call!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>producing a note-book</i>). It's fanciful,
    perhaps but, if you don't mind waiting a little, I should like
    to contribute&mdash;not my card, but a sonnet. I feel one on
    its way.</p>

    <p><i>Bob P.</i> Better make sure the tomb's <i>genuine</i>
    first, hadn't you? Some say it <i>isn't</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>exasperated</i>). I <i>knew</i> you'd make
    some matter-of-fact remark of that kind! There&mdash;it's no
    use! Let us go.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Why, your sonnets seem as skeery as those
    lizards there! I hope JULIET won't ever know what she's missed.
    But likely you'll mail those verses on to her later.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>She and</i> BOB P. <i>pass on, laughing.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>following</i>). She only affects this
    vulgar flippancy to torment me. If I didn't know
    <i>that</i>&mdash;There, I've left that infernal pot behind
    now!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Goes back for it, wrathfully.</i></p>

        <p><i>In the Amphitheatre</i>; Miss PRENDERGAST, PODBURY,
        <i>and</i> VAN BOODELER, <i>are seated on an upper
        tier.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>meditatively</i>). I suppose they charged
    highest for the lowest seats. Wonder whether a lion ever nipped
    up and helped himself to some fat old buffer in the Stalls when
    the martyrs turned out a leaner lot than usual!</p>

    <p><i>Van. B.</i> There's an ingenuous modernity about our
    friend's historical speculations that is highly refreshing.</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> There is, indeed&mdash;though he might have
    spared himself and <i>us</i> the trouble of them if he had only
    remembered that the <i>podium</i> was invariably protected by a
    railing, and occasionally by <i>euripi</i>, or trenches. You
    surely learnt that at school. Mr. PODBURY?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> I&mdash;I daresay. Forgotten all I learnt at
    school, you know!</p>

    <p><i>Van. B.</i> I should infer now, from that statement, that
    you enjoyed the advantages of a pretty liberal education?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> If that's meant to be cutting. I should save it
    up for that novel of yours; it may seem
    smart&mdash;<i>there</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> Really, Mr. PODBURY, if you choose to resent
    a playful remark in that manner, you had better go away.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Perhaps I had. (<i>Rises, and moves off
    huffily</i>). D&mdash;&mdash; his playfulness! 'Pon my word,
    poor old CULCHARD was <i>nothing</i> to that beggar! And she
    backs him up! But there&mdash;it's all part of my probation!
    (<i>Here</i> CULCHARD <i>suddenly appears, laden with
    burdens.</i>) Hullo! are you <i>moving</i>, or what?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I am merely carrying a few things for Miss
    TROTTER. (<i>Drops the copper pot, which bounds down into the
    arena.</i>) Dash the thing!... (<i>Returning with it</i>.) It's
    natural that, in my position, I should have
    these&mdash;er&mdash;privileges. (<i>He trips over a
    blanket.</i>) Conf&mdash;Have you happened to see Miss TROTTER
    about, by the way?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Fancy I saw her down below just now&mdash;with
    BOB. I expect they're walking round under the
    arches.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page293"
       id="page293"></a>[pg 293]</span>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Just so. Do you know, PODBURY, I almost think
    I'll go down and find her. I&mdash;I'm curious to hear what her
    impressions of a place like this are. Such a scene, you
    know,&mdash;so full of associations with&mdash;er&mdash;the
    splendours and cruelties of a corrupt past&mdash;must produce a
    powerful effect upon the fresh untutored mind of an American
    girl, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.'s voice</i> (<i>distinctly from arena</i>). I'd
    like ever so much to see Buffalo BILL run his Show in
    here&mdash;he'd just make this old circus hum!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.'s voice</i> (<i>indistinctly from topmost
    tier</i>). Almost fancy it all....
    Senators&mdash;<i>equites&mdash;populus&mdash;pullati</i>...
    yellow sunlight striking down through <i>vellarium</i> ...
    crimsoned sand ... <i>mirmillo</i> fleeing before
    <i>secutor</i> ... DIOCLETIAN himself, perhaps, lolling over
    there on <i>cubiculum</i> ... &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> The place appears to excite Miss PRENDERGAST's
    enthusiasm, at all events! [<i>Sighs.</i></p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Rath-er! But then she's no end of a classical
    swell, you know! [<i>Sighs.</i></p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>putting his arm through</i> PODBURY's.)
    Ah, well, my dear PODBURY, one mustn't expect too much, must
    one?)</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> I <i>don't</i>, old chap&mdash;only I'm afraid
    <i>she</i> does. Suppose we toddle back to the hotel, eh?
    Getting near <i>table d'hôte</i> time.</p>

    <p>MR. W.S. GILBERT ought to have been engaged as Counsel in
    the <i>Duplany</i> v. <i>Duplany</i> divorce case, when,
    attired in his wig, gown, and hands&mdash;ARTHUR SULLIVAN's
    full hands of course&mdash;he could have put the question which
    Mr. GILL had to make a pint of putting, <i>i.e.</i>, as to the
    occasional use of strong language. Set librettically,
    "<i>Firenza la bella</i>" would have answered in her sweetest
    strain and with her most bewitching Florentine manner, "I never
    use a big big D." To her the Counsel, not Mr. GILL but Mr.
    GIL-BERT, would have retorted musically, "What
    '<i>never</i>'?'" To him the fair Witness, replying on
    consideration, "Well,&mdash;hardly ever!" Then the chorus, led
    by the Judge, Sir FRANCIS JEUNE, and joined in by all the
    Jeuniors of his Court, would have wound up this portion of the
    proceedings, if not harmoniously, at least tunefully. For
    future reference, it would be known as "the Big Big D-ivorce
    Case." How such occasional musical outbursts would lighten the
    labours of the Court through many a tedious case! And in a
    <i>cause un peu célèbre</i> like this, where there is a crammed
    house and enthusiastic audience ready to take every point, and
    risk possible expulsion rather than remain quiet, what a relief
    such a burst of song would be to everybody's pent-up feelings
    and bottled-up excitement. The comedy is all very well, but the
    finale is tragic, the last scene of all being from the
    historical subject with modern application representing "MARIUS
    seated among the ruins" of what might have been a happy
    domestic life.</p>

    stop any more old Port from leaving of their shores, unless we
    guv 'em up ever so much of the hinside of Afrikey. Ah, that was
    a pannick that was, and all us Waiters felt it severially, but
    her Majesty's Guvernment, seeing at wunce the sollem natur of
    the threat, made such terrems as settled the hole affair, and
    Port went down as ushal.</p>

    <p>Well that was bad enuff in all conshense, but it was nothink
    to what we has all bin threttened with, from the Lord MARE on
    his throne of power to the umblest waiter of his royal
    estaberlishmunt. I herd ony last week from the Gildall Beedle,
    so it must be trew, that ever so many of what's called
    Comishunners of Suers had cum a tearing down stairs from their
    place up above, a cussin and a swearin like mad, becoz the
    Kumpany as was a jest beginnin for to lite up our streets with

    for more nor another year. Well that was bad enutf for them as
    likes that tell-tail lite, "but wuss remanes behind," as the
    Pote says; and I reelly ardly xpecs to be beleeved when I says,
    as they threttened not to lite up the onered Manshun Ouse to
    the werry last! and as the gas has all a bin taken away, there
    wooden have been not no lites, and consequently not no Dinner
    in that grand Ome of Horspitallerty, not for twelve long weary
    hungry munse!</p>

    <p>The shudder as run thro Gildhall when this was fust
    menshund, the Beedel tells me, was sumthink quite orful, and
    the langwidge used, ewen by anshant Deppertys, sumthink not to
    remember, but sumthink to forget as soon as posserbel.</p>

    <p>However, a gentle reminder from them as could do what they
    threttind, whether it was six months' hard, or suppenshun from
    wun of their own tall, red lamp postesses, brort them all to
    their sewen senses, and everythink is to be reddy for the fust
    State Bankwet at the reglar hour on the reglar day; and so the
    dedly wroth of the grand old Copperashun is apeezed, and there
    is no longer enny tork of a mighty band of hindignent Welshers

    <h2>TWOPENCE PLAIN.&mdash;A PENNY COLOURED.</h2>

    <p>MR. PUNCH, HONOURED SIR,</p>

    <p>I have just received a copy of <i>The Almanack</i>, which,
    if I may say so, is worthy of the approach to the close of "the
    so-called Nineteenth Century." Not to go further into
    particulars, I should say that "A Doll's Diary" will be hard to
    beat in contemporary Christmas literature.</p>

    <p>It was, Sir, not with the intention of making this obvious
    remark that I break in upon your reflections. My purpose was
    moved by discovering on the front corner of this work of
    Literature and Art the legend, "Price 6<i>d.</i>; <i>Inland
    postage</i>, 2<i>d.</i>" Looking at the postal cover which
    lightly bore the treasure o'er land and sea to this ancient
    town, I discovered, that coming under the "foreign postage
    rate," 1½<i>d.</i> had served the turn. Whence it appears, that
    had I, as usual at this season of the year, been at my country
    address, to be found in <i>Dod</i>, the <i>Almanack</i> would
    have cost me, or someone else (it is beside the argument),
    2<i>d.</i> Whereas, being hundreds of miles away from the
    placid pastures that surround The Kennel, Berks, the postage is
    25 per cent. less in amount. In one case, where the larger sum
    and the less amount of labour were concerned, the English
    Post-Office, taking all the money, charge 2<i>d.</i>; in the
    other, calling in the assistance of Belgium and Germany, and of
    course sharing with them the plunder, 1½<i>d.</i> is held to be
    the fair recompense for the immensely extended labour. Isn't
    this something in the way of reversal of the ordinary trade
    axiom, as who should say "Twopence Plain; a Penny,
    Coloured"?</p>

    <p>In its immediate application it is a small thing. People
    privileged to receive <i>Punch's Almanack</i> through the post
    will not quibble over a half-penny. But it is evident that a
    system which embodies an arrangement that needs only to be
    stated to have its absurdity demonstrated, wants looking
    after.</p>

    <p>I beg to give my friend, the new Postmaster-General, notice
    that, as soon as the House meets, I shall put a question on the
    subject. In the meanwhile, and always I am, honoured Sir, your
    obliged and obedient servant,</p>

    <h2>A SAFE NOVEL.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>With Interpolated Notes by Our Own Legal
    Adviser.</i>)</h4>

    <h4>CHAPTER I.&mdash;THE LOVERS' PARTING.</h4>

    <p>The sun was setting behind the towers of the church of
    Greenborough-on-the-Driblet.</p>

    <p>[It must be clearly and distinctly understood that this
    village is not intended to refer to any parish with the word
    "green" introduced in the title&mdash;all incumbents of such
    livings being the most honourable and distinguished of
    men.]</p>

    <p>Two persons were bidding one another adieu. The first was a
    man in the prime of life wearing a suit of tweeds.</p>

    <p>[Please note that the name of the tailor is not given, and
    it is not to be assumed for a single moment that this refers to
    any individual in particular.]</p>

    <p>The girl, for she was only a girl, wore a costume of almost
    puritanical simplicity.</p>

    <p>[Again no dressmaker is singled out for discussion. It is a
    purely fancy portrait.]</p>

    <p>They were both in tears. For the hour had come for their
    parting.</p>

    <p>[It is necessary to state that by "parting" no reference is
    made to any existing firm of hair-dressers.]</p>

    <p>For a moment they were silent, watching Phoebus as he
    descended in his glory of purple and gold.</p>

    <p>[This refers to the mythical God of Day, and is not to be
    confounded with a member of a well-known firm of manufacturers
    of blacking.]</p>

    <p>Then they spoke to one another.</p>

    <p>"ZOZIMUS," she murmured, softly, "and is this our last
    meeting?"</p>

    <p>[The name of ZOZIMUS was selected for the hero because it is
    an uncommon one, and consequently unlikely to be confounded
    with any more frequently-used designation. If by an unlucky
    chance there <i>is</i> a ZOZIMUS, he is assured that the
    coincidence is purely accidental.]</p>

    <p>"I am afraid it must be so, my ZULUWOLFA," was the
    heartbroken response.</p>

    <p>[Again the name has been chosen on the same lines as the
    selection of ZOZIMUS, and the explanation above given may be
    taken as having reference to both.]</p>

    <p>"And so you are going across the sea in a boat?" she
    queried, trying to smile, in spite of her blinding tears.</p>

    <p>[No boat in particular is intended, and we have the author's
    authority for saying that he has the greatest respect for every
    official connected with the shipping interest.]</p>

    <p>"Yes," he returned, sadly, "it is my father's wish, and I
    trust that in a new world I shall find greater prosperity than
    I have been able to achieve in dear old England."</p>

    <p>[No reference is made in the above to any weekly
    publications, although, perhaps the <i>World</i> and
    <i>England</i> may have been taken as titles for Saturday
    journals. Before passing this passage, we received the
    assurance of the author that he felt the deepest esteem for the
    Editors of the periodicals thus inadvertently mentioned.]</p>

    <p>"Well, my beloved, you will soon see me; and, dead or alive,
    I shall be by your side in the spirit."</p>

    <p>[This passage is not intended to single out any particular
    firm of distillers]</p>

    <p>"We shall meet again," he cried, pressing her frail form to
    his breast. "Indeed we shall meet again."</p>

    <p>[It must not be assumed that there has been a misprint in
    the above passage, and that reference is made to any particular
    firm of butchers.]</p>

    <p>And so they parted!</p>

    upon seventy years of age, to fourteen days imprisonment with
    hard labour&mdash;a matter to which attention was called when
    the Coroner held an inquest in the gaol on the poor old
    fellow's body. It would be interesting to know the names of
    these "un-worthies," so that they might be gibbeted as a

    <h2>TOLD IN TAGS.</h2>

    <p>We have recently been favoured by a communication from a
    firm of Publishers, which informs us that, in a story sent for
    review, "by an oversight of the binder," the Epilogue was
    omitted, and inclosing that interesting document. We have
    perused the four pages with so much pleasure, that we suggest
    that, instead of writing the whole story, novelists, in future,
    should only publish the final chapter, which might be
    beneficially compressed into a few lines. As a lead, we print a
    few conclusions, to serve as models:&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Specimen of a Happy Ending</i>.&mdash;And so there was
    nothing more to do but to get married, and consequently EDWIN
    led no happier bride to the altar than his much persecuted and
    greatly tried ANGELINA. So the bells of Tinkleton rang out
    their merriest chimes as the sun went down on the stately
    towers of Castle Sympleton.</p>

    <p><i>Specimen of an Unhappy Ending</i>.&mdash;So, at peace
    with all the world, still holding the hand she loved so well,
    and smiling a smile that brought tears into the eyes of the
    good old Colonial Bishop, FLORA faded away into the Golden
    Dream she knew so well!</p>

    <p><i>Specimen of a Mysterious Ending</i>.&mdash;And so HUGH,
    carrying a lamp in his right hand, and grasping the blade of
    his sword in his left, entered the cave of which he had heard
    so much. Will he ever return? Who can tell?</p>

    <p><i>Specimen of a Comic Ending</i>.&mdash;"So it was you,
    after all!" cried the Cheesemonger, with a shout of
    laughter.</p>

    <p>EGERTON SWELLINGTON smiled an assent.</p>

    <p>"Then all I can say," continued the worthy trader, "is, that
    a miss is as good as a mile."</p>

    <p>And, for once in his life, Mr. DOUBLECHIN was absolutely
    right!</p>

    <p><i>Specimen of the Poetical Ending</i>.&mdash;So with the
    blue-bells sighing soft music, and the stars chanting their
    soothing lullaby, the sweet soul of MARIA realised the truth
    that&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>'Tis better to have loved and lost,</p>

            <p>Than never to have loved at all.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>Specimen of the Shocker's Ending</i>.&mdash;And with a
    gasp and a reel, Sir RALPH fell back, back, back, down the
    precipice, and an hour later was found by the patrolling
    coast-guardsman a quivering mass of senseless humanity!</p>

    <p><i>Specimen of the Christmas Ending</i>.&mdash;And so,
    linked hand in hand, father and mother, son and daughter,
    husband and wife, nephew and niece, bowed their heads beneath
    the holly and mistletoe, and wished one another, with a
    heartiness that told volumes, "A Merry Christmas and a Happy
    New Year!"</p>

    <h3>QUERIES FOR CAMBRIDGE EXAM. PAPER.&mdash;</h3>

    <p>1. If the Vice-Chancellor's authority to punish immorality
    within the bounds of the University town of Cambridge is to be
    done away with, will he still retain the then quite superfluous
    title of <i>Vice</i>-Chancellor?</p>

    <p>2. On the abolition of "The Spinning-House," as plucked
    candidates are often spoken of as men who were "spun" for
    such-and-such an examination, might not the Senate-House be
    known as "The Spinning-House"?</p>

    <h2>BY GEORGE!</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[In a recent libel action, brought against an author by
        an African merchant, Mr. GEORGE MEREDITH was called as a
        witness. He said:&mdash;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>"The story in dispute passed through his hands as reader
        for the publishers. Asked in cross-examination if he
        thought that the opening of the story relating to the
        hero's mother did not offend against the canons of good
        taste, the witness answered that it was the attempt of a
        writer of serious mind to be humorous. It might be almost
        called a stereotype of that form of the element of humour.
        It was a failure but still passed with the
        public.&mdash;The Judge: A kind of elephantine
        humour?&mdash;The Witness: Quite so. I did not like it, but
        one would have to object to so much."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>There the report of Mr. MEREDITH'S evidence ends.
        Exigencies of space apparently caused the omission of a
        great deal of it. Fortunately it is in our power to supply
        this deficiency.&mdash;ED.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:40%;">

             </a>Very much En Évidence; or, George in the box.
    </div>

    <p><i>The Judge</i>. Quite so, Mr. MEREDITH. I may say for
    myself that I fully understand you. But perhaps it would be
    well to explain yourself a <i>leetle</i> more clearly for the
    benefit of the jury.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. George Meredith</i>. My Lord, I will put it with a
    convincing brevity, not indeed a dust-scattering brevity fit
    only for the mumbling recluse, who perchance in this grey
    London marching Eastward at break of naked morn, daintily
    protruding a pinkest foot out of compassing clouds, copiously
    takes inside of him doses of what is denied to his external
    bat-resembling vision, but with the sharp brevity of a rotifer
    astir in that curative compartment of a homoeopathic
    globule&mdash;so I, humorously purposeful in the midst, of
    sallow&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>The Judge</i>. One moment, Mr. MEREDITH. Have you
    considered&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Mr. G.M.</i> Consideration, my Lord, is of them that sit
    revolving within themselves the mountainously mouse-productive
    problems of the overtoppingly catastrophic backward ages of
    empurpled brain-distorting puzzledom: for puzzles, as I have
    elsewhere said, come in rattle-boxes, they are actually
    children's toys, for what they contain, but not the less do
    they buzz at our understandings and insist that they break or
    we, and, in either case, to show a mere foolish idle rattle in
    hollowness. Nor have the antic bobbings&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Sir Charles Russell</i> (<i>cross-examining</i>). Really,
    Mr. MEREDITH, I fail to follow you. Would it not be
    possible&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Mr. G.M.</i> Ay, there you have it. In truth, the
    question looks like a paragraph in a newspaper, upon which a
    Leading Article sits, dutifully arousing the fat worm of
    sarcastic humour under the ribs of cradled citizens, with an
    exposure of its excellent folly. For the word. That is it. The
    word is Archon, with extended hand summoning the
    collaboratorically ordained, misbegotten brood of
    shock-shilling pamphlets to his regal presence&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>The Judge</i> (<i>testily</i>). No doubt that would be
    so, but it brings us no nearer to a decision upon the question
    of humour in the particular passage of the book which contains
    the alleged libel.</p>

    <p><i>Sir Charles Russell</i>. Perhaps I can shorten matters,
    my Lord. Now, Mr. MEREDITH, will you be kind enough to explain
    the following passage from a book with which you may perhaps be
    acquainted. (<i>Reads</i>.) "This he can promise to his points.
    As for otherwhere than at the festive, Commerce invoked is a
    Goddess that will have the reek of those boards to fill her
    nostrils, and poet and alderman alike may be dedicate to the
    sublime, she leads them, after two sniffs of an idea concerning
    her, for the dive into the turtle-tureen. Heels up they go,
    poet first&mdash;a plummet he!" Is that humorous, or, if not,
    what is it?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. G.M.</i> Elephantine, I think; yet not elephantine
    altogether, since of them that crash amid jungle of atrophied
    semi-consciousness, strivingly set upon an overtopping
    mastery&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Sir Charles Russell</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Thank you.
    The passage is from <i>One of our Conquerors</i>. Here is
    another:&mdash;"Reverting to the father and mother, his idea of
    a positive injury, that was not without its congratulations,
    sank him down among his disordered deeper sentiments, which
    were a diver's wreck, where an armoured livid subtermarine, a
    monstrous puff-ball of man, wandered seriously light in
    heaviness; trebling his hundredweights to keep him from dancing
    like a bladder-block of elastic lumber." And while you are
    about it, pray inform the Court what you mean by "the vulgarest
    of our gobble-gobbets," or by "a trebly cataphractic
    Invisible."</p>

    <p><i>Mr. G.M.</i> Truly, the louder members of the grey public
    are fraternally instant to spurn at the whip of that which they
    do not immediately comprehend. But to me, plunged chokingly in
    translucent profundities of aquamarine splendour, not of a
    truth that in the heights above splendour resides not,
    chidingly offering a fat whiskerless cheek to the blows of
    circumstance, this was ever the problem of problems. How to
    write. How not to write. This way and that the raging fates tug
    the hapless reader, pillowed he upon the vast brown bosom of
    his maternal earth, or lurefully beckoning the dim
    shadow-shapes of dodecahedronic cataplasmatic centipede fatally
    conditioned to the everlasting pyramid of a star-pointing
    necessity. So&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>The Judge</i> (<i>with determination</i>). Mr. MEREDITH,
    the Court is sincerely obliged to you for your extremely
    valuable evidence. We are unwilling to detain you any longer.
    Besides, after what you have said, the point is as clear as
    daylight. Good morning, Mr. MEREDITH, good morning. You may
    become a trebly cataphractic Invisible.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
